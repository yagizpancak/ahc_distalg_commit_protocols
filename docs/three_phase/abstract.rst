In the realm of distributed systems, the Three-Phase Commit Protocol (3PC) stands as a significant advancement over its predecessor, the Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC), in ensuring transactional consistency across multiple nodes. The main challenge lies in orchestrating a coordinated agreement among distributed participants while mitigating the risks associated with uncertainty and failure scenarios. Addressing these challenges is crucial for designing robust transactional systems capable of maintaining data integrity and system reliability in dynamic environments. The 3PC protocol introduces an additional phase to the commit process, aiming to enhance fault tolerance and reduce the likelihood of blocking scenarios encountered in 2PC. However, it also introduces complexities in managing three distinct phases of decision-making and ensuring synchronization across distributed nodes. This paper contributes by investigating the implementation of the 3PC protocol in distributed systems, assessing its performance under various scenarios, and conducting a comprehensive comparison with 2PC to evaluate its effectiveness in ensuring transactional consistency, overhead, complexity, and fault tolerance. Through this exploration, valuable insights are gained into the practical implications and trade-offs associated with adopting the 3PC protocol, guiding the design and optimization of transactional systems for real-world applications in distributed environments.
