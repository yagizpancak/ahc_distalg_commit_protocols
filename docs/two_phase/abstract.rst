In the realm of distributed systems, the Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC) is a pivotal method for ensuring transactional consistency across multiple nodes. The primary challenge lies in orchestrating a coordinated agreement among distributed participants without disrupting ongoing processes while maintaining fault tolerance and scalability. Successfully addressing these challenges is paramount for designing robust transactional systems capable of preserving data integrity and system reliability. The 2PC protocol facilitates coordinated decision-making between a coordinator and multiple participants, ensuring either a commit or abort decision is uniformly agreed upon. Despite its fundamental role, the 2PC protocol faces challenges in managing concurrency, ensuring fault tolerance, and minimizing overhead. This paper contributes by exploring the implementation of the 2PC protocol in distributed systems, examining its performance under various scenarios, and conducting a comprehensive comparison to evaluate its effectiveness in ensuring transactional consistency, overhead, complexity, and fault tolerance. Through this investigation, critical insights are gleaned into the practical implications and trade-offs associated with employing the 2PC protocol in distributed environments, aiding in the design and optimization of transactional systems for real-world applications.
