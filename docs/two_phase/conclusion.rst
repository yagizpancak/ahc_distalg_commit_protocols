Conclusion
==========

In summary, the Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC) is integral to distributed systems, ensuring transactional consistency across multiple nodes. It tackles challenges of coordination, atomicity, and fault tolerance, crucial for data integrity and system reliability. Despite its benefits, 2PC faces issues like blocking and increased latency. Our analysis highlighted its significance, challenges, and comparison with previous solutions. Future research should focus on optimizing its performance and addressing limitations. Ultimately, 2PC remains pivotal for robust distributed systems, shaping the future of computing.
