abstract = {Protocols that allow operational sites to continue transaction processing even though site failures have occurred are called nonblocking. Many applications require nonblocking protocols. This paper investigates the properties of nonblocking protocols. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a protocol to be nonblocking are presented and from these conditions a method for designing them is derived. Both a central site nonblocking protocol and a decentralized nonblocking protocol are presented.},
